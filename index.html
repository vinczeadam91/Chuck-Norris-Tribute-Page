                <h2>About Chuck Norris</h2>
                <p class="content">
                    Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist, actor, film producer
                    and screenwriter. After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts
                    championships and later founded his own discipline, Chun Kuk Do. Norris is a black belt in Tang Soo
                    Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and Judo.[2] Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in
                    martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969).
                    Friend and fellow actor Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of the Dragon
                    (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested to him that he
                    take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977) which
                    turned a profit. His second lead Good Guys Wear Black (1978) became a hit, and Norris became a
                    popular action film star.

                <p class="content">
                    Norris would go on to star in a streak of bankable independently-made action and martial arts films,
                    with A Force of One (1979), The Octagon (1980), and An Eye for an Eye (1981). This made Norris an
                    international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like Silent Rage (1982) with Columbia,
                    Forced Vengeance (1982) with MGM, and Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon films to
                    sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting with Missing in Action (1984), which proved to be
                    very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile
                    action films with Cannon, becoming their leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included
                    Invasion U.S.A (1985), The Delta Force (1986), Firewalker (1986), etc. Apart from the Cannon films,
                    Norris made Code of Silence (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he
                    played the title role in the long running television series Walker, Texas Ranger, from 1993 until
                    2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies, including Delta Force 2
                    (1990), The Hitman (1991), Sidekicks (1992), Forest Warrior (1996), The President's Man and its
                    sequel (2002). Norris made his last film appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables
                    2 (2012).

                    My favourite Chuck movies are:

                <ul>
                    <li>Logan's War: Bound by Honor</li>
                    <li>Walker, Texas Ranger</li>
                    <li>The President's Man 1-2</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="content">While in the military, Norris's rank units were Airman First Class, 15th Air Force, 22d Bombardment
                Group, and 452d Troop Carrier Wing.

                Norris has received many black belts. These include a 10th degree black belt in Chun Kuk Do, a 9th
                degree black belt in Tang Soo Do, an 8th degree black belt in Taekwondo, a 5th degree black belt in
                Karate, a 3rd degree black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu from the Machado family, and a black belt in
                Judo.
